    Which is the zipper(s) we are doing up.
    
    Via Mez to its G, being a G regulating valve.
    
    =head2 And electrodes
    
    Adds intros into its output.
    
    Can get a fork a rip itself up, playing from the top/whereever whenever.

    Make another Zop to let on/tidy all the tests
    Singling to itself over local net
    It is the thing you want to stretch out with a G

    Your travel agent and its clients, who are yours
    Trips go down the Throat, can do osc8 totape as a method arounder

    Yeah. Go parked. W in for Matu.
    Singly, shift G to 
    W is shared G space, which is a table otherwise...
