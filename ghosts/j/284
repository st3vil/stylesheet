    some goals:
    - efficiently educating on A passage of time
    - J to take < 200ms
    - not noticing anyway
    - Elvising running the shower
    - unpatch, failing, patch, passing in a few seconds
    
    =head3 future of sleep: Doming
    A starts works, D are their completion
    
       C   E
     A   D 
       C   C
    
    A C9[C...] completes D and elvises a clone
    
    D - the Aing grouping items sprout inside
      z C & A to include C/group A workload
      provide osc-like cha/continuity without osc,
        yet be the atomicness osc uses to commit,
        and load with decor/nativities to make for mediation
          R:I is now being the osc workload gatherer + commit
            which should work on >=1 'pages' of osc at a time
              eg elvising from ...
              or the whole/9er
            rolling the others,
            being able to async progress,
              do work in parallel or not...
    make unities early to sleep/calculate desires better
      eg. when A is @28, the state can be considered D:early
      eg. when Jpin, S makes domes, which can then be known about
    internal buzz. pages of its ground.
      get composited into D:top, C9[C...] post-osc
      which gets hoisted/elvised into J/W timespace elsewhere,
        the macro-J Doming-looking action: hosting stuff.
    so to:
      make arbitrary groups
        for groups sake:
          naming stuff
          handling streams
        to stabilise/refine our sense of activity
      transport C out of time,
        so J>7 can help J<7 (sleep)
        osc-think may play with things outside of osc,
         < holds that state in a dome it hopes to pull in?
      locate them as possible actions,

        Elvising pointing in here,
          as Teing is
        giving Desire pathways to trace processes
    
    Domes may iterate X/V or some structure from another Dome,
      it may be important to iterate locally and do remotely,
        they become transactions
    Desire might want to do something,
    as a new elvis pointing into here would
     Teing is a kind of elvising
       and is the float:right upside down triangle of stuff
         the small network-edge pile coming down into

         resolve to best case or so:
       if it were a different J:
        enter it, changes input to thisJ
        decide to redome thisJ to involve that,
          or seeing our change come back to us
       Matu-ish out-of-time with %push gravitate reruns
      redo R building on changed elvisory?
      see 'rebuild %push to use e'
       %push currently injects the remote %ball%movingin
         which will not work if its asleep
         but it could be brought around about as fast if:

    o names extruding, like X but with:
      connection to a dome:
        where/when they would have emerged (gonerism)
          eg. from the ground, or some picking of Rc&s
            done-ish by %slep

    o Display2, that goes via X instead of yup:
        traversal iterators that choose a name system to use,
          X is the given base name system
    
    o elvising coming out or going in on the X
      and transacting the change of it
       as Domes, which have versions of Domes going into them
       an osc that keeps everything it sees would be first
        and be the wandering frontiers of change

          T/$W:City.y.owner = $W:City,

             find refs for $W:City/*

              T is species of edges, as is W:PuTe
         so we know the minimum clone-over move to make,

    see I and repackage:
       A:u makes .I
         mixed from many .I,
         got from /js/
         with async for update/check
       A.4:
        has loop bits, local culture
        .I:
         is everything, mixed up with StyleHut
         .i is all StyleHut,
          figure out what we need to keep
         never goes async, is trusted to be maintained,
         .w:
          has only this %namedcode thing
       A.5:
         looks neglected
         .w:
          is the spot, y&tw for $way
           they s&dige and s&now, G&way asyncs
           want to digwaypoll them, make sync
          all scooped up by Shovel, per test run
           which can make sync prior
    I.w is totally incidental,
    1s&minds[uname] = A c&N[4s&mind[t]]
     u deals with W via /js/, mixes onto Normal
    G&question (and other asyncers) should provide:
      ttl, ready=1 on callback

     how it starts:

        sends it A&loadI and Stylehut
         which includes HutNuts (begoin/jsung)
       G&begoin -> G&jsung,'NutMachine' cb -> G&Jinthe
         jsung looks like A:u but overwrites any A.I[t] = W:of it loads
         Jinthe sets up listeners,
          waylays NutGravy, defines function,
           waylays NutReady, more waylays.
     
     will start:
     < A&loadI a simple A:u@6 etc for basic mind mixing
       gather more mind, global functions, start loop
      should less async, and:
       be totally new ev/e hookup:
        Display:
         lose on.A
          use attr t/cv, attr sip if sJ
          and lookup to the sips of 4s somewhere global
          A.4 must always know about elvising
         lose jQuery,
          moving elements only as needed,
          text inputs not rebuilding every time
       
       ways to keep track of updates...
        make an islanding that can digwaypoll for:
          w change
          W change is regular /W/ with dige...
        know W that contain other W we are watching,
          digwaypoll for notify of W changing?
          could be wired into /W/
           not for the same socket?
         future /W/ storer is an elvising with a route,
          only then demands stringify to get across the net
