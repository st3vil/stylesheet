        # Relosophy of C and R

    R similar to A, but want to fall faster
     could perhaps be throated together... maybe
      thRoat wants to return data iterations to step iterations in a pin
    bassline C get I->R+ from A&o pin/gear assortment of action
      juggling dives in, points and progress
        of expanding/shrinking pools in the pool
          and filling itself in for working through time
          once inflated...
    needs a playspout
         compiles fast change checkers (0-2) once inflated (8)
          so lowlevel changes (container re-ref) cause higher modes
          told/finding how innards roll through time (A&ip++)
    laying schemes on what objects are
          producing a unified linguistic core
        what they are becomes, in layers.
        and tangles, hyperlinked.
    
    drawing macro cellular boundary
      based a bit on A.1 != Y.1 along the A
       then Rc&d and Ry&up, hy&up
    already micro cells (C) are bound,
      points lead through the pointy ones
    
    pointing to enlarge parts should shrink unpointed parts
    
        giving light pools an interface to one another
          os may be comissioned from n
            it finds its own previous thinking, checking it...
          presenting ways to understand from the moment G&n
            so os owns the things life from there
        from where it originally was scored
          eg. this showing the C subsisting sense of the C itself
           as edges
        
        =head1 Srupto
        
        for growing mind in a pin with sections
          the hook and the iterator switch places:
            iteration happens in a while that returns
        
        S Knowing 2 $r %unknown
          should Re 'Knowing' for each C s&unknown thing
          with this section generating/emitting the layer
        S Knowing 3 $r
          can take M
        S Knowing 4 $r
          similarities?
        and also I/s/unknown
          u should be generatable soon, with such a trick

        and other hanging around ness...
        
        os makes Elvising of the Res
          a better way to hold history? in Jc&o now
          e want to have pointer stuff
            the things point/naming a bunch of atoms
            maps/traces of string
        
        the time-independent interface to osc action
        
        R are essentially
          for going into the C and its state through time, etc
          in many pools, overlapping, notice objects had by each other
            eg. a bunch of C touring a cyclically linked structure
          a quiet link, to be modulated/packed into Cs
          produced and consumed by the process
          to represent, as thinking has things to it.
          for things qualities to get framed,
            process and its C-side project through it.
          for locating in the living mind (travel)
          bits dangling from it, leading to more bits
            as a Jup-place (on its Elvising)
            and the travel, anything coming out.
        repeatable stumbles.

        getting into the minds of itselves,
        scribing c/sc as far as desired
         want to map out parallel bunches of C for display,
           or representing jobs going on (Elvising)
         strategies want to know if their reason changes...
         want to know the usual R properties, for shrinkage.
        
        schemas for drawing stuff with Cs
          presenting the spaces as two (ish) layers (c/sc)
