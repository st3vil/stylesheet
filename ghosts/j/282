    some goals:
    - efficiently educating on A passage of time
    - J to take < 200ms
    - not noticing anyway
    - Elvising running the shower
    - unpatch, failing, patch, passing in a few seconds
    
    =head3 future of sleep: Doming
    A starts works, D are their completion
    
       C   E
     A   D 
       C   C
    
    A C9[C...] completes D and elvises a clone
    
    D - the Aing grouping items sprout inside
      z C & A to include C/group A workload
      provide osc-like cha/continuity without osc,
        yet be the atomicness osc uses to commit,
        and load with decor/nativities to make for mediation
          R:I is now being the osc workload gatherer + commit
            which should work on >=1 'pages' of osc at a time
              eg elvising from ...
              or the whole/9er
            rolling the others,
            being able to async progress,
              do work in parallel or not...
    make unities early to sleep/calculate desires better
      eg. when A is @28, the state can be considered D:early
      eg. when Jpin, S makes domes, which can then be known about
    internal buzz. pages of its ground.
      get composited into D:top, C9[C...] post-osc
      which gets hoisted/elvised into J/W timespace elsewhere,
        the macro-J Doming-looking action: hosting stuff.
    so to:
      make arbitrary groups
        for groups sake:
          naming stuff
          handling streams
        to stabilise/refine our sense of activity
      transport C out of time,
        so J>7 can help J<7 (sleep)
        osc-think may play with things outside of osc,
         < holds that state in a dome it hopes to pull in?
      locate them as possible actions,
        as bumping into a S-ection kinda defines it

      know inputs in a tracable way
        Elvising pointing in here,
          as Teing is
        giving Desire pathways to trace processes
    
    Domes may iterate X/V or some structure from another Dome,
      it may be important to iterate locally and do remotely,
        they become transactions
    Desire might want to do something,
    as a new elvis pointing into here would
     Teing is a kind of elvising
       and is the float:right upside down triangle of stuff
         the small network-edge pile coming down into
         the big contenty pile of isness
     Schemas too, float their potential/unfoldment
       down holes they start matching

    %slep/I:Slepingness & me&slan:
      Tool injects things (Te tangulate) with a %slep
        a way to map their changes fast and sleep
          change of container vs. the values within etc
          Teing (if versioned by Elvising %slep) also
     < could be faster/lessR: callback a huge ==-ish plucker,
       50ms 3%slep could get down to 4ms?
    
    Tool openness
      configures those injectoids
    < has a more timely %differ growing out of it
      real interesting later
    < %aTool while tests...
      < converting Display to a big C that we can Lines
      < making a refpool across the testrun
    
    < Elvisory re-slaning on %push to it?
       is the elvis delivery mechanism:
        give edifice of deliverableness
         resolve to best case or so:
       if it were a different J:
        enter it, changes input to thisJ
        decide to redome thisJ to involve that,
      redo R building on changed elvisory?
      see 'rebuild %push to use e'
       %push currently injects the remote %ball%movingin
         which will not work if its asleep
         but it could be brought around about as fast if:
    < Te the %moves to Elvisory/anywhere
       with a watch for completion and callback/expiry
    
    < replace ravel with Doming and Display2
    < TEST io.i z much
    
    # anyway
    
    back to Pass...
    
    o general Passness
      %push:
        vanishing %exactly should half open
        call itself on move start/end Doing/Done, etc
      %Cit:
        shall configure in Das
          < while Pass is paused, vv.
        there they become/add City%doing for:
          a %Cit, with:
            that thing (usu previous %doings Wout)
            elvising re. crawling into W.y.R.c.X/V etc
          converting Display to a big C that we can Lines
       expect noise around the actual thing
        present change out of the essential scope of the check as such
         a %differ thing
        put notes in test data
         < compile ugly from that
      %testrun, attach to whatever we %play->%run
        implies ./%steps/%doings
          < ways to break from %doings,
            more result crunching in this/another A
          
    
    o test gonerism (XV)
    < with extra bits of %Cit asserting deeply
      'fixed' error in %push:
          between R:I and R:*, R:C wasnt using arriveRbitX etc
          was:
           state falls apart too easily after error:
            %ball%pushed has to give them %their every time
            %push%moves also,
           are hanging on me&rollbs, which depends on b
            apparently bogus
           cant be pushed back together with the other side because:
            push%move after the fall ends up Co inside Co
              not knowing about the Co/$Redo thing
              is a setup for the %testrun:
                A.5erver (Co) gives you a fresh A.4 ($Redo),
                  which you push steps to
                could be clearer than:
                 %move,from:Co,to:T,into
                 %move,from:Co,to:Co *
              TeCo could express such strategy,
                besides what is to be.
          Remember to avoid that next rebuild.
       
    o test sleepology
      with extra tools for Pass to:
        rec/play elvising:
          - %doings for W:PuTe to crud the Elvisory
          < at the [click=>{path...}] level
            or nearabouts, we could get started...
             the Tool %aTool
        dump/stash configurations of %Cit
          as %doings for W:PuTe + W:Lookat etc
          see also 'R looks at R'
          < do them at times injected to... (Ting)
    
    o test tests (%play wanders %testrun)
    
    o test Pass itself (recurse another? later)
    
    o 'rebuild %push to use e'
      %checkout the tangley varieties of %push
    
    o unify name extrusion (see names extruding)
      like X but with where/when to D,
        alt names and fuzzentations (figure name changes)
          inc. crunchable path descriptions in various datalang
        universal gone/unnoticed system
    
    %push gives T(..Co..) five clicks to find J,
      then it is woken up
    
    make this data pointer (Cit)
     add %doings that Cit the same way
       and can share refs perfectly,
       showing where internals began
         set free with an everything bisector

      Matu process with %ball

    o and then making a coderupper and way in-outer
      to the rest of the rennovation...
        starting a new page of html,
          built-in and W-contiguous
            the simple funtimes embedded in the page,
            if browser compatible, Wake up and do anything
        I-ing up Sevo, then placing more A-ily,
    
    o names extruding, like X but with:
      connection to a dome:
        where/when they would have emerged (gonerism)
          eg. from the ground, or some picking of Rc&s
            done-ish by %slep
              could describe path or so
        decide once D:in !%more
          D:new == D:old to sleep, or:
          clone D:new to D:out and ...
            becomes someones D:in
              border control
        
    o Display2, that goes via X instead of yup:
        traversal iterators that choose a name system to use,
          X is the given base name system
    
    o elvising coming out or going in on the X
      and transacting the change of it
       as Domes, which have versions of Domes going into them
       an osc that keeps everything it sees would be first
        and be the wandering frontiers of change
     
    o making the R an A.
      compiling ravel into throat?
    
    fairly slow slow, need:
     more sleep (R to 1/2 and no further) (%slep)
     ongoing bisection of A

    for recompiling everything,
     G&t gets it from A*%believed
    that may be part of or leading to elvising,
      the hyper-everything trans-anyway maculata
        (see head1 Elvising)
     which lives in the same form:
     <Source> /Transform|Select\ <Output>
    any of that may need to live somewhere,

           Doleux -e
             %here: Doleux # version of grabbed thing
             %etc: whathaveyou
    then Vang relives that %push
    and Experie knows its got stuff incoming
      which it might already have pulled in,
        (it must also disconnect)
      or is able to pull in with/without Vang being awake
    
    =head1 push

     once done a bunch of something, you can look at them.
     as gravity.
    
    #c=head1 A=A and the Give
    
    merge R into A.
    A is R, throat is Ring, sooner of things
      throat - where Instructions iterate over Culture
    # here we do the entire Ceeing instantly to the enclosing timeframe
    (taking pictures of state that is about to change)
    in general, knowing if the A is for a queue or for right now
     + the usual about how queues crud around
    patching time... all Cnetobj
     it will look like itself, except for where it ruptures/grows
    
    =head1 Srupto
    we want to allow pin Steps to be Instructions
      a way to grab anything at any rhythm
    
    the baseline C->osc mode may encode Instructions:
     Cont
       thinger 3 s:'s&er++' %of:Lat
    becomes:
     Cont   %W
       Lat  W:of %W
         thinger 3 s:'C.c.er++'
    then:
     Cont transports
     Lat is I stuff (%W with %z), posited as being Lat
     thinger is encoded (Latc&W:of)
    such that it is mostly ready for action:
    A.3+ believes in Cont%W
    A.1 somewhere wants Lat
        (or thinger, knowing things like Lat might contain it)
     by elvising G/$pathtoA1/Lat,
      finding/choosing a Lat,
      which must 6 the whole of what it bit
        (W around might be only indexing of what can be got)
    do-ing
    then that elvising attaches to A.1/G/Lat/Cont
     which A.3 hoists/attaches/encodes/stores as some of:
       A.3/G/Cont # no idea wherefor but small edge
         # does updates for change at the large-object level
       A.3/G/Cont/$pathtoA1 # know where to send attention
         # andor where in the stream of Cont the change is!
       A.3/$pathtoA1/G/Lat/Cont # Q/A format per place
         # lends itself to network change sensitively
     easily all at once
     hyperspheres of definition named simply
    and store perhaps on the first line of the W in Lines:
     AyeOne   %W,G:Cont@238hfd34;Normal@49d8c9ff
       Stuff   %produced
    and something incorporating Cont and more looks like:
     AyeOne   %W,G:Cont@238hfd34;Normal@49d8c9ff
       Cont   %W
       Lat  W:of %W
         thinger 3 s:'C.c.er++'
         thingo 3 s:'C.c.o++'
       thingo 3 s:'s&er++' %of:Lat
    
     when thinger blows up, inspected:
        thinging from AyeOne%W/Lat%Wz/thinger
        and as asking around about random things:
        find AyeOne%W/Cont%W (aka Cont%W) also has Lat/thinger
        things may be asleep about here,
        but may be able to show source code, compile/mutate it
    
    looking at the G would be lots of io-ing
      things packed into it
      checking those injection/projection points
      is bitXgonerism
      relying on percolating those things
        along things that we can relive
       or shut down, rearrange, tamper with
      as osc-compatible:
       various $Gish of $Wish may be attached to $Wish
         so long as osc understands what/how to involve/mixage
       even outside itself on $Woth/$pathtoWish/$Gish
        just as $Teing is an index of landstructions to go here
        we have the chance to take with us or trust to recreation anything
        
       they are understood by the I, made meaningful where $Wish is
      and hoist/dehoist its structures into other places
        with others doing the same thing
      and also just the giant tabulation
    
    #c ph (post R re-combobulation)
    osc does new A:I over the old one
      probably rolling everything
     A:C make separations of a thing or things
      lets its content be distributed and depended on
      pattern matched and made into elvisings out to W:of,
      putting into a further self
    
    so C may need separation to preserve various objectives:
     A:n C being the most-uphill thing
     A:C = C coming in
     A:s = C for doming/playing sc forward
     A:C = C going out
     A:W = C encoding/compressing
    they all have ways to know about their previous lives
    
    another life of the underlying shape:
    A - receivability
    C - received culture
    G - culture + momentum, implantations
    T - what could not fit in,
      its mysteries/problems/developments,
      its inclusion to/from the world
        to as in for Teing into some W-position,
        from as in its life was because of such insTruction
      the T is like the G
        dealing with a big tangle of comings & goings
    the T decides/dealswith the edge of the picture,
    by hoisting/making the content misfiture,
      such that a big C can have its anomalies adjusted
    
    the layer above io, provides mode ala c&el
      io needs to readwrite A&X/A&V/A&Xo
        to provide the memory of the current play
        in parallel to the previous one,
          noticing when C views should complete (gonerism)
    diversifying how to match $thing against $Thing,
      what we are looking for,
      what level of understanding to borrow what from
    yet producing that sc-lang about how it was written:
      Some%sounds = {index of direction to points of resonance}
    there could be:
      Cs making the structure of any kind of index
      direction Cs, coming from/with merge/over/with/etc
      resonating Cs, beings in a constellation unknown to themselves
    
    A:s would be driving towards a goal
     juggling dives in, points and progress
       of expanding/shrinking pools in the pool
          and filling itself in for working through time
          once inflated...
     compiles fast checkers of 0-2 wobble once inflated
      so lowlevel changes (container re-ref) cause higher modes
    needs a playspout
     told/finding how innards roll through time (A&ip++)
     pointing to things, as if regrouping into another
      laying schemes on what to do
       producing a unified linguistic core
        what they are becomes, in layers.
        and tangles, hyperlinked, wandering
    
    drawing cellular boundary
      s&z = more C,
        so might its A&z = more A
      based a bit on A signage (A.so = $so)
        $so might be via Ay&up (would know if soA&ip aboves us)
        A.pileup of things involved/leading to A
          should cleanup per J or so,
          but provide being/groupology along A
      measures of depth/appropriateness
       A&d (A.c.d)
      thickness/gravitational of cultural boundary-ness
    
    pointing to enlarge parts should shrink unpointed parts
    
        giving light pools an interface to one another
          os may be comissioned from n
            it finds its own previous thinking, checking it...
          presenting ways to understand from the moment G&n
            so os owns the things life from there
        from where it originally was scored
          eg. this showing the C subsisting sense of the C itself
           as edges

        for growing mind in a pin with sections
          the hook and the iterator switch places:

           Teing (Instruction overloading) from 'above'
           Regurgitants
        Js can be trusted to get their TGW meaning to a point,
         so they can be reset natively
          consuming all input, producing all output,
