    Ive got a bunch of parts, most go like ->
    ITS stuff you will slide off into other things from
    its already sitting there in the universe,
    we just need to find the center of it
    so we can make efficient systematising 
      (everything trans fats)
    trips around it.
    stylehouse is the shapes of the.
    how to get the lumps singing.
    nothing in my way will indicate how to do it
    it renders intelligence into the climatic
    fig route the way of itself into the matter
    lazy is safer
    solve the public spaces issue, traffic
    its what we all mean to each other, has to be a
    tons of drumming hiding in these walls
    technology is a huge pile of snakes, I saw MW crawling along there
    the mind is a tube of spiders, it travels many people, to the hands!
    gotta be each domey, bass. yu need to hear some sound.
    its alive elements, the world is the crossover world.
    listening for plot rhymes.
    you just chase a bunch of energy into the
    first thing that comes along that feels
    right
    so simple youve just got to make a mess and let it classify it
    but you have to really...
    its M when its particular things, and W when its whatever. T got it up there.
    always connects to some human plot to do this
    diffusing manifolds of characterisations into one another
    is the game, the events, the evrything
    fronteir sport, getting it to flop around into just the it
    the drifters are in trouble (by 30), we should all nail stuff down
    we should redo how we rebuild as a way to rebuild, worshipping death
    the drifters are how it works though!
    there are all these ways through it, there must be
    things around are sending things areound
    subjecto genetics yourself you
    
    I sometimes go for these ridiculous walks holding a guitar and a guitar case (Im a $2)
    so much pressure behind this symbolic doorway that Im just being
    it is attractions, babylon like prison or fort.
    I melted without the coding hallutimations.
