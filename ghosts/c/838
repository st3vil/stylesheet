    Ive got a bunch of parts, most go like ->
    ITS stuff you will slide off into other things from
    its already sitting there in the universe,
    we just need to find the center of it
    so we can make efficient systematising 
      (everything trans fats)
    trips around it.
    stylehouse is the shapes of the.
    how to get the lumps singing.
    nothing in my way will indicate how to do it
    it renders intelligence into the climatic
    fig route the way of itself into the matter
    lazy is safer
    solve the public spaces issue, traffic
    its what we all mean to each other, has to be a
    tons of drumming hiding in these walls
    technology is a huge pile of snakes, I saw MW crawling along there
    the mind is a tube of spiders, it travels many people, to the hands!
    gotta be each domey, bass. yu need to hear some sound.
    its alive elements, the world is the crossover world.
    listening for plot rhymes.
    you just chase a bunch of energy into the
    first thing that comes along that feels
    right
    so simple youve just got to make a mess and let it classify it
    but you have to really...
    its M when its particular things, and W when its whatever. T got it up there.
    always connects to some human plot to do this
    diffusing manifolds of characterisations into one another
    is the game, the events, the evrything
    fronteir sport, getting it to flop around into just the it
    the drifters are in trouble (by 30), we should all nail stuff down
    we should redo how we rebuild as a way to rebuild, worshipping death
    the drifters are how it works though!
    there are all these ways through it, there must be
    things around are sending things areound
    subjecto genetics yourself you
    
    I sometimes go for these ridiculous walks holding a guitar and a guitar case (Im a $2)
    so much pressure behind this symbolic doorway that Im just being
    it is attractions, babylon like prison or fort.
    I melted without the coding hallutimations.
    its a mythology of methodology, fully vented lifeformrer.
    where nothing connects to, you.
    you may have to first get something out of nothing, so it realises.
    get stylehouse, add your goo.
    oh wow look at this extreme conversation we could model up.
    everyone does what you do back to you, or back somewhere
    which must really be forwards somewhere if in means back
    theatre geopsyche. linguistic core. guitrations.
    u it. shovelviscode.
    the metaphysics is very metaphysics.
    have you seen the C? its very nice.
    forming on the plane. castles.
    !
    what man learns from computer. it wil just not be if we dont do it right.
    creates space to hold arguments properly, potentially.
    its the kind of technology that it is.
    dangled energy smashups. for something you have no idea of.
    
Work: | # for Steve
     render Vind
     js Movy seeks 
     the pap drifters, time dilation mods, 
laters: | # for YOU
    h opens into hi n  t   r    o
    quick table of contents maker or lost in big tables
    Steve being a crazy abstract musical statue
    big continuous cloud of speech bubbles, styled walls
    the typewriter is typing into a bunch of speech bubbles
    its got to be working overtime! with bunches of people studying and continuing
    webbing eddies
