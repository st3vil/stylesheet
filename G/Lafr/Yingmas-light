         maybe there are handlers
         an inter-node o backend
       &nodei - transports via %%eto, wanders off
       < conversely:
       &nodeo might turn into:
        i %%e:hunter who will bring back the goods
       &nodei might merely:
        find %ein serving async, immediate return
       
       &nodee,to,t,a,q
        is &nodei $to %%e:t,...q
        expecting %%efrom:to,e:t,...a
         supposing $to:
          &nodeein,t,&from,q{produce %%a-ish}
           which &nodei back to $from
           including %%e
       basically,
        $from %%stuff -> $to, esp if diff
        comes back to $from once &settle,
         or sooner if $to %%answer -> $from
       usu. &nodei,
        moving intention around

         attend when different, by way of:
       
       brackstilling
        has %%stuff changed?
        if still:
         &nodee can same answer same question
          immediate return potential
        if diff:
         the $to must attend,
          returning to $from once &settle
           or sooner if $to &nodei back to $from
          all %Ying managed
        helps:
         receivers of %%efrom,...
          eg CBing (value contest/news)
          accept versions of it when ready
          see 'check CBing &nodei is as it was'
          could -%%e%done or +%%rebase if diff
           if &nodeein +%done it when done
           or %%rebase = prescribed differencing,
            is applied, via a big-deal filter, eg:
              a %Compiling in its push-phase,
               can decide to redo, because CBing, already
               depending on the algorithm (||= C percolation)
                to be able to tune inputs near the end of their workload
                including just after it,
                 if the answer is invalidated
                is nice reflexive terrain
       
       eg.
        $from = a %Compiling sequencing operations:
         makes Know%fully and selects %%Live
          $Live = &nodee $to %%Live %%e:fully
           and e:fully is ein there, subplot:
            an anyone-elected %acty=3
            must produce %%Live,
         
         $from %%waits for a response?
          or %%fail if e%edone and !%%Live
         
         $to avoid doming their 'main thing'
           eg CBing
          until all %%e%done
           would new CBing before $from receives %%Live,
           so $from receives also the new CBing,
            bound to the %%Live used for thinging
