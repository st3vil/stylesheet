g pretends to be a %Search
 tuesday:
  load way as wjs

  picking towards Fiveplan:
   < %Search index wjs
   < me&way looks at %Search
    > several, using their ein() out of time
    
  < load me.code and wake processes
  < ch()/G&c says harvester, put in A
  < use wjs as G&way
    < ways should know about ways inside ways
      most of them will static args

    Tab in \S\) should jump over 2 characters
    e:A+* elvis while paused
     something for tagging the line
     
 %Abodis around
   SCA some things to do,
     ie Comal again
     slep driven data dump
     catching certain e at certain Rings, from Evelse

     proto J so the real one is 9 points clicking in 
 %Slope
   finds neighbours
   the center of the findables
    %ball, %Cit, %Zavmo types of sprawl
 %Differ
   text relationising lab
    defines %Here<->$P
     how to push, pull, what changed
      how to i/o or patch bits of them
    breaks down patches
     important lines leading into what changed
     chunks compare with each other,
      to get moves as low diff gone<->new chunks
     chunks accepted as forms
      for more chunks to be more acceptable
        when the same ish change occurs in many
      2 chunks should show the most residual bit of identity
    sees t y c sc amounts
     such that the same code works any model:
      %Code/%Line/%Ch
       everything slightly t, the name of something
        esp heading positioned, rare words
       c more the syntax
       sc the knowables
      %Cit/%nkness/%gkness/%someindexes/
       bits could be found in the code
    make steps for CodeMirror to unfold subdocs
   the way it makes pointers in to code is wanted for:
    %Codo search, %Abodis pointers
    %Code unfolding
   the way it logisticises potential aspects "":
