    maybe if stepso3 saw them %sleeping...
    kind of want another %wou-ish
  < big fat reset
  %Abodo wants %%stabilised, renew %supr
   pause, circuits, unify brackism
   no Ying for %Abodis
  text lab a way
  
  < Search:wjs should not think theyre ready if !wc&code
  < cm: start closed, scroll sometimes
   < define foldfunc
  < multi-throw situations want %Slope to see
  < Words:
  < track <
  < boost<0 that ope=0.5
     the bit of nothing next to t being half it
  < not
  < hsl l is not dark enough
  < the %ein(C) interface for %_ting
  < ch()/G&c says harvester, put in A
  < me&way + Search from the top, its own mundws
  < me&t should know about ways inside ways
    most of them will static args

     something for tagging the line
     
 %Abodis around
   SCA some things to do,
     ie Comal again

     catching certain e at certain Rings, from Evelse

 %Differ
   text relationising lab
    defines %Here<->$P
     how to push, pull, what changed
      how to i/o or patch bits of them
    breaks down patches
     important lines leading into what changed
     chunks compare with each other,
      to get moves as low diff gone<->new chunks
     chunks accepted as forms
      for more chunks to be more acceptable
        when the same ish change occurs in many
      2 chunks should show the most residual bit of identity
    sees t y c sc amounts
     such that the same code works any model:
      %Code/%Line/%Ch
       everything slightly t, the name of something
        esp heading positioned, rare words
       c more the syntax
       sc the knowables
      %Cit/%nkness/%gkness/%someindexes/
       bits could be found in the code
    make steps for CodeMirror to unfold subdocs
   the way it makes pointers in to code is wanted for:
    %Codo search, %Abodis pointers
    %Code unfolding
   the way it logisticises potential aspects "":
