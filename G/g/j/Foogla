some goals:
- efficiently educating on A passage of time
- J to take < 200ms
- not noticing anyway
- Elvising running the shower
- unpatch, failing, patch, passing in a few seconds

A starts works, D are their completion

   C   E
 A   D 
   C   C

A C9[C...] completes D and elvises a clone
 D commits Gs, Es swarm T (*/W/*)
  G wants the resources near-ish
  T returns to the desire resolver

D - the Aing grouping items sprout inside
  z C & A to include C/group A workload
  provide osc-like cha/continuity without osc,
    yet be the atomicness osc uses to commit,
    and load with decor/nativities to make for mediation
